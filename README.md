# Investigate-A-Dataset[Medical Appointments]
## Introduction
* The dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused
on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
* A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row

## Summary :*What are the factors that majorly influence patients not showing up to appointments?*
* The top variables that are positively correlated with showing up to an appointment are Age
,Hipertension , Diabetes , SMS_received respectively.
*  Ages between 0 and 39 equally miss appointments as well as show up to appointments.These
ages are unpredictable in determining for sure if a patient will miss an appointment.
* Patients with Hipertension and Diabetes miss appointments more than those with other
diseases.
*  Patients who did not receive notifications of their appointments miss appointments more than
those that receive at least one notification
*  A limitation of this dataset is the inability to know what period of day an appointment was
scheduled for.This could play a major part in establishing if a patient missed an appointment
because it was too early or too late.
